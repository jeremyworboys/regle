# Rules

Rules are the core concept of Regle (and also it's name ðŸ™„).

A rule is created using either:

- An inline function
- `createRule`

A rule takes the value (and optional parameters) as input and returns a result as output.

The **result** can either be:

- `boolean`
- An object containing at least the `{ $valid: boolean }` property.

The boolean represents the result of the validation.

## Inline rules

You can write inline rules as simple functions that receive the value being evaluated as a parameter. Use the `InlineRuleDeclaration` type helper for enhanced type safety.

``` ts twoslash
// @noErrors
const someAsyncCall = async () => await Promise.resolve(true);
// ---cut---
import type { Maybe, InlineRuleDeclaration } from '@regle/core';

const customRuleInline = (value: Maybe<string>) => value === 'regle';

/** Async rule that will activate the $pending state of your field  */
const customRuleInlineAsync = async (value: Maybe<string>) => {
  return await someAsyncCall();
};

/** You can return any data from your rule as long as the $valid property is present  */
const customRuleInlineWithMetaData = ((value: Maybe<string>) => ({
  $valid: value === 'regle',
  foo: 'bar'
})) satisfies InlineRuleDeclaration;
```
